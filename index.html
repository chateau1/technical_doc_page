        <p><code>HTML</code> stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language for websites and therefore is essential to any software developers repitoire. </p>
        <p>Use <code>HTML</code> to structure all of the content on your websites. While you can do basic styling with <code>HTML</code>, you can use many other languages to style your pages in a more advanced way. First, master the basics of <code>HTML</code> to organize the page. Then move on to other langauges (CSS, Javascript etc.) to make your website more interesting and responsive to its users.</p>
      </section>
     <section class="main-section" id="elements">
        <header class="main-header">Elements</header>
        <p>All of your <code>HTML</code> web pages will be made up of various elements. These elements instruct the browsers to display your content the way you choose.</p>
        <p>Your pages will be broken down into sectional elements like: header, body, main, footer etc. You can use other elements to further structure your content, such as headings, paragraphs etc.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="attributes">
        <header class="main-header">Attributes</header>
        <p>You should use attributes to further organize and define all of the elements on your page. They are also extremely useful for accessibility purposes.</p>
        <p>Examples of common attributes:
          <ul class="second-list">
            <li>Links</li>
            <li>Images</li>
            <li>Styles</li>
            <li>Titles</li>
            <li>Class</li>
            <li>ID</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="forms">
        <header class="main-header">Forms</header>
        <p>Forms can be utilized to collect user information (inputs). </p>
        <p>There are lots of different ways to set up your forms. Decide how you want to collect the input (ie. submit button, checkbox, date selector etc). Use fieldsets to organize all of the information you want to collect.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="additional_info">
        <header class="main-header">Additional Info</header>
        <p>You can continue delving into HTML as there is a lot more to learn! But remember that although you can do plenty of things in HTML (like style your pages), using other languages to do so instead can make you pages more responsive and pleasing to the eye. Using other langues will save you a LOT of time by allowing you to style multiple elements at once with a single line of code. Instead of repeating yourself over and over. It is also helpful for others who will be looking at the code. Simplified code is helpful for everyone who needs to reference it.</p>
        <p>The logical next step in your coding learning path will be CSS. Good luck on your journey to becoming a software developer!</p>
